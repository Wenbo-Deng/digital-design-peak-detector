# digital-design-peak-detector
Implement a peak detector design in a FPGA.

for details can read https://seis.bristol.ac.uk/~sy13201/digital_design/ECAD/A2_index.htm

Designed and implemented a peak detection system with modules, including the peak detector, data source, and communication links based on UART.
The peak detector task involves processing user-typed words in the terminal, identifying the peak byte, and returning it along with the three bytes preceding and following it.

For test and verification details, please see the report.
